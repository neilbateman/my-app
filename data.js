      skills: "My focus has been on React Native, and I emphatically embrace the philosophy of “learn once, write anywhere”. However, this web page is made with just HTML and CSS. Selecting the proper technology is essential, and because this website uses no unnecessary frameworks leading to a bundle bloat, it is 1875 times smaller than the average website. Notice that page load speed! I design websites with accessibility in mind. The colors are chosen to provide AAA contrast ratio for the visually impaired and all elements contain descriptive alt attributes."
